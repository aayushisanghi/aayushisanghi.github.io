		"What I did here":"● Designed a plugin, using React, for QuickBooks Online, allowing users to upload and tailor invoices, attracting over 10,000 users.
		● Used RxJava to optimize the data ingestion process for the Quickbooks reports engine, using in-memory database operations, support
		for import of data from multiple resources, and making code execution reactive.
		● Worked in the Global Identity Platform Team to pre-fill never-entered data using third party services. Was instrumental in
		implementation of an address widget and profile widget to minimise data redundancy and inconsistency, and pre-filling existing data.
		● Designed and implemented a comparator tool using Javascript, to analyse the transition to a new microservice-based login flow for
		Quickbooks online."
